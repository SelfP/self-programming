# self-programming
This project is focused on self-programming machines.

This project mey contain three big parts.The fiest part is NLP(Neuro-Linguistic programming) ,which makes it possible for the machine to understand the meaning of people's command.The second part may be most difficult part,I call this part .It's designed to help the computer analyses and disassembles the tasks,and then find the best way to solve the problem.The third part is coding,which means the computer has to know the rules of one or more than one programming languages and uses those rules to code by itself.Through the three parts,the machine will get the solution of the problems put forward by people.

THE FIRST PART:NLP

To understand semantics, large effort is still needed on RNN/LSTM improvements and even new models…

✦ RNN/LSTM’s problem:
1.impotent for too long sentences (semantic drift);
2.grammatically problematic;
3.highly frequent pattern domination (less variation);
