# self-programming
This project is focused on self-programming machines.

In twentieth Century, the invention of the machine greatly improved people's labor efficiency and quality of life. Washing machines, vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens and other harvester have freed housewifes' hands, rice transplanter has freed the peasants' hands, CNC lathes and intelligent machine hands have freed the worker's hands. In the 21st century is the world of coding and smart devices. With the increasing amount of datas and the requirements of the function, the processes of coding become more complex. Here we explore a new way to develop an intelligent self-programming machine. Through which can automatic generate complete functional codes according to the task descriptions given by people , so as to reduce the burden of programmers. I hope this idea can  active the talent people like you and participate in my group bravely to accomplish this seemingly impossible task!

This project may contain three big parts.The fiest part is NLP(Neuro-Linguistic programming) ,which makes it possible for the machine to understand the meaning of people's command.The second part may be most difficult part,I call this part intelligent analysis and abstract description.It's designed to help the computer analyses and disassembles the tasks,and then find the best way to solve the problem.The third part is coding,which means the computer has to know the rules of one or more than one programming languages and uses those rules to code by itself.Through the three parts,the machine will get the solution of the problems put forward by people.

Ch 1:NLP

To understand semantics,I am going to use RNN and LSTM.

However there are still some problems with them.
✦ RNN/LSTM’s problem:
1.impotent for too long sentences (semantic drift);
2.grammatically problematic;
3.highly frequent pattern domination (less variation);
